# Burp Tracer
This is a simple extension for Burp Suite which takes your current site map, extracts each request parameter, and searches for responses where its value is present. This tool was developed with output validation testing (e.g. XSS) in mind.

The tool respects the scope that you indicated in the "Scope" tab of the "Target" module.

## Usage
It's simple. Just click "Start" and wait for it to complete.

The output tree's hierarchy is formatted in the following order:
* Input Website
* Input Endpoint
* Input Request
* Input Parameter
* Output Website
* Output Endpoint
* Output Request
* Output Excerpts
              
This way, you can see the corresponding responses where each input value is rendered.

## FAQs

### How is this different from Reflected Parameters or the "Input Returned" result generated by the Scanner?

I honestly can't say for sure since, as of the time I wrote the tool, I never touched the Scanner nor the Reflected Parameters extension  (primarily because I'm too poor to afford Burp Suite Pro).

However, by reading the description of the Reflected Parameters extension...

> This extension monitors traffic and looks for request parameter values (longer than 3 characters) that are reflected *in the response*.

...I can say that the main difference between this tool and Reflected Parameters is that **the parameter values in Reflected Parameters are searched for in the corresponding response of the request that issued the parameter rather than the entire site map**.

**Tracer searches the entire site map**. So, say for example, you registered an account for a website. You issued the `username` parameter to the `/register.php` endpoint. Reflected Parameters would light up if the corresponding response to the `POST` to `/register.php` contains the `username` you entered. Tracer, on the other hand, would light up even if the corresponding response to `/register.php` doesn't contain the `username` you entered **as long as it pops up elsewhere in the site**.
